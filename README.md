## CRAS Agenda📝
#### Our aim is increase engagement in cognitive science. This is a collaborative learning environment designed to help you gain confidence in engaging in academic discussions.
So please note, this is a society for anyone who is interested in cognitive science. This society is fun specifically because it attracts people with naturally different knowledge and ideas, sparking interesting conversations! After-all, we need discrepancies in understanding for teaching and learning.

#### Overall aims and objectives:

-   Create a supportive space for cognitively-interested members of the university to help each other on their learning journeys and express their passion for cognitive science together!

-   Develop academic skills in critical thinking and theoretical knowledge. This will mainly come from practice in forming ideas about cognitive research articles and effectively articulating this to others.

-   For those interested in a career path in cognitive science, this can also be a space to gain encouragement and feel excited about pursuing a professional identity as a cognitive researcher, by developing complimenting soft and hard skills, and gaining networking opportunities when we go to seminars.

#### Specific activities:

-   Each fortnite in the evening, meeting to discuss a designated research article to chat and have debates about. We can rotate who chooses this paper to whoever would like to each time.
  

-   Gain insight into the world of cognitive science academia together through organised visits e.g. cognitive symposiums, such as those the Center For Cognitive Science (COGS) hosts.

-   Organising symposiums in which any member has the opportunity to host a small presentation about an overarching theme.
