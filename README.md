## CRAS Agenda📝


#### Our aim is to increase engagement in cognitive science. This is a collaborative learning environment designed to help you gain confidence when engaging in academic discussions.

So please note, this is a society for anyone who is interested in cognitive science. We encourage a diverse range of knowledge and ideas as these spark interesting conversations. After-all, we need discrepancies in understanding for teaching and learning!

#### Overall aims and objectives:

- Create a supportive learning space for cognitively-interested members of the university.


- Help members develop academic skills including critical thinking, theoretical knowledge and conceptual articulation; as well as soft skills including confidence in public speaking and collaboration.

- Encourage those interested in pursuing a professional identity as a cognitive researcher.


#### Specific activities:

- Every fortnight, we meet on-campus to discuss a chosen research article. The presenter rotates each meet on a volunteer basis. More info on this role can be found [below](#presenter-guidance).

- CRAS symposiums in which all members have the opportunity to present a short talk relating to an overarching theme.

- Organised visits to researcher-led symposiums to help aspiring academics gain insight and build connections.

### Presenter Guidance


All members are welcome to present a paper! We will rotate this role each meet on a volunteer basis.

-  **Role of presenter:** Select the paper for the next meet and prepare its discussion.

  
-  **Responsibilities of presenter:**


- Within a week of the previous meet, provide the next paper alongside some planned questions. This will be shared on the discord channel. Each member is then free to contribute to the planned questions.


- At the meet, provide an initial synopsis of the paper and explain the rationale behind your selection.


### Asking good questions

  

* There is no such thing as a stupid question, although you should aim to provide thoughtful, open-ended questions.

  

* Meets aren't about who's best at memorisation. Rather, the paper is the reference-point for our discussions. This means questions follow on from the paper, so may be about interpretations (from any cognitive discipline), opinions on a methodology, implications etc... it's up to you.

  

* Please note, questions should account for roughly 45 minutes of discussion, and leave time for the two questions we ask at the end of each meet:
	
	1. How does this paper link to the paper we previously discussed?

	2. Feedback: Why did you like/dislike this paper? How did you find this meet? Is there anything you'd change, or like to see more of next time?

For inspiration...

* Refer to previous meets (which can be found on this repository!), and consider your experiences in academic discussions, such as seminars- what questions prompted the most engagement?

  

* Some online resources can help give you an idea, but take them with a pinch of salt... each journal article club is unique, so what works for one won't necessarily work for another. For example, many sources online advise rigidly-structured, formal article clubs, while at CRAS you're free to use your own creative freedom and discretion.

  

* AI can be a useful tool to generate questions that incite critical engagement, just make sure you agree in your own assessment!
